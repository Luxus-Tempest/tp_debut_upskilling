How n8n works

--------------------------------------CONTENT--------------------------------------

n8n is a modern, open-source workflow automation tool that enables users to connect apps, APIs, and
services through a visual, node-based interface.

Key concepts:

1. ** Nodes :**
- Each node represents a task, such as triggering a workflow, making an API request, transforming
data, or sending an email.
- Nodes can be native integrations (like Facebook, Twitter, HTTP Request, Email) or custom JavaSc
ript code.

2. ** Workflow :**
- A workflow is a directed graph of nodes, defining the sequence and logic of automation.
- Workflows are triggered by events like schedules, webhooks, or manual execution.

3. ** Data Passing :**
- Nodes receive input data from previous nodes, process it, and pass output data downstream.
- Data is structured as JSON objects and arrays, allowing complex transformations.

4. ** Credentials :**
- API keys, OAuth tokens, and other secrets are managed securely via n8n's credential system and
are referenced by nodes without exposing them in the workflow JSON.

5. ** Error Handling :**
- Nodes can have error workflows attached to handle failures gracefully.
- Errors can trigger alerts, retries, or conditional logic.

6. ** Extensibility :**
- Users can create custom nodes or execute arbitrary JavaScript within workflows.
- Supports integrations with REST APIs via HTTP Request nodes.

7. ** Import/Export :**
- Workflows are saved as JSON and can be exported or imported between n8n instances for sharing o
r backup.

8. ** Execution :**
- Workflows can run synchronously or asynchronously, supporting complex branching, loops, and con
ditional execution.

The latest version supports robust API integrations, dynamic credential management, and advanced wor
kflow scheduling, making it ideal for building multi-step automated processes like social media anal
ytics aggregation and report delivery.
