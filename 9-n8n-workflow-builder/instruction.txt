- Linkedln API (past week)
3. Process and unify the data into a structured summary:
- Calculate key metrics: engagement rate, reach, impressions
4. Combine all platform data into one aggregated report.
5. Send an email with the summary report to predefined email addresses.
6. Include error handling nodes to catch and log failures.
