Please generate the JSON code for an n8n workflow that automates the weekly
collection of social media analytics from Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedln. The
workflow should:
- Trigger every Monday at 8:00 AM.
- Fetch analytics data for the previous week from each platform.
- Calculate engagement rate, reach, and impressions.
- Aggregate all data into a summary report.
- Send the summary report via email to a specified list.
- Include error handling and modular node design.
Provide the full workflow JSON for direct import into n8n.
